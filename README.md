### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adam, but on the Internet I usually go by @hev (or sometimes @aHev when that's taken).
I work for VMWare on projects related to Observability for Kubernetes and Cloudfoundry. I am also
interested in Secure Software Supply chains, Developer UX/GitOps, and COVID data science. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Anchore
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Dev Sec Ops
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: File an issue? 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to ride bikes (Road, MTB and Snow)
